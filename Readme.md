#A mod inspired by Atomic Science

This mod currently adds 2 blocks and 1 item
To use the fission reactor, simply place it down in the center of a 3x3 water pool and using a hopper, funnel a fuel rod into the block.  It will continue running until it depletes its fuel.  When the fuel rod is depleted remove it with a hopper at the bottom of the reactor.  However, in order to capture power you must place a turbine block above the water blocks, at positions 0,1 , 1,0 , 1,2 , 2,1 in respect to the upper right hand corner of the water pool.  The turbine blocks will transfer 100 Tesla's when ever the water block below the turbine is evaporated to the block above them.

Crafting the fusion reactor: (obsidian, stone, obsidian), (stone, diamondblock, obsidian), (obsidian, stone, obsidian)
turbine: (cobble, redstonedust, cobble), (redstonedust, cobble, redstonedust), (cobble, redstonedust, cobble)
fuel rod: (glasspane, stoneslab, glasspane), (glasspane, redstoneblock, glasspane), (glasspane, stoneslab, glasspane)
